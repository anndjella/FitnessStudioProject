_**Fitness Center Management Application**_

**Description**

One of the main functionalities of the application is the ability to create new fitness center members. The operator can easily enter data about new members, and it is possible to search for existing members, which significantly saves time and energy. If a member changes their phone number, last name, or any other personal information, it is possible to change their data, and if a member is no longer interested in the fitness center, there is also the possibility of deleting their membership.

**Member Categories**

There are different categories that members can belong to, such as employed, retirees, children, and students. This allows members to receive discounts depending on which category they belong to.

**Monthly Bills**

Members have monthly bills. There is a possibility for members to attend multiple group programs per day, so the bill amount increases or decreases depending on whether the attendance at the group program is paid or not. There is a possibility of retroactive payment, but if a member does not pay for all their attendances until the last day of the month, funds will be deducted from their card.

**Benefits**

This application provides a complete and comprehensive system for managing members and group programs of the fitness center. It provides the center operator with a powerful tool for organizing and tracking all aspects of exercise in their center, and provides members with quick and efficient service.
